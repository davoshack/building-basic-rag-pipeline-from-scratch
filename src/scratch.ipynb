    "Introducing Llama 3.1 Llama 3.1 405B is the first openly available model that rivals the top AI models when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and multilingual translation. With the release of the 405B model, we’re poised to supercharge innovation—with unprecedented opportunities for growth and exploration. We believe the latest generation of Llama will ignite new applications and modeling paradigms, including synthetic data generation to enable the improvement and training of smaller models, as well as model distillation—a capability that has never been achieved at this scale in open source.\n",
    "As part of this latest release, we’re introducing upgraded versions of the 8B and 70B models. These are multilingual and have a significantly longer context length of 128K, state-of-the-art tool use, and overall stronger reasoning capabilities. This enables our latest models to support advanced use cases, such as long-form text summarization, multilingual conversational agents, and coding assistants. We’ve also made changes to our license, allowing developers to use the outputs from Llama models—including the 405B—to improve other models. True to our commitment to open source, starting today, we’re making these models available to the community for download on llama.meta.com and Hugging Face and available for immediate development on our broad ecosystem of partner platforms. Model evaluations\n",
    "For this release, we evaluated performance on over 150 benchmark datasets that span a wide range of languages. In addition, we performed extensive human evaluations that compare Llama 3.1 with competing models in real-world scenarios. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model is competitive with leading foundation models across a range of tasks, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Additionally, our smaller models are competitive with closed and open models that have a similar number of parameters.\n",
    "Model Architecture As our largest model yet, training Llama 3.1 405B on over 15 trillion tokens was a major challenge. To enable training runs at this scale and achieve the results we have in a reasonable amount of time, we significantly optimized our full training stack and pushed our model training to over 16 thousand H100 GPUs, making the 405B the first Llama model trained at this scale.\n",
    "To address this, we made design choices that focus on keeping the model development process scalable and straightforward. We opted for a standard decoder-only transformer model architecture with minor adaptations rather than a mixture-of-experts model to maximize training stability.\n",
    "We adopted an iterative post-training procedure, where each round uses supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. This enabled us to create the highest quality synthetic data for each round and improve each capability’s performance.\n",
    "Compared to previous versions of Llama, we improved both the quantity and quality of the data we use for pre- and post-training. These improvements include the development of more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data, the development of more rigorous quality assurance, and filtering approaches for post-training data.\n",
